       " \ttext = What better time for the U.S. Army to considering cutting its numbers than right now, with tensions between the U.S. and both Russia and China likely at multi-decade highs? But that's exactly what a new budget proposal suggests, according to a new report by Bloomberg. The Army would fall under 1 million soldiers for the first time in 20 years under the new proposal, with active duty Army falling from 485,000 soldiers to 473,000. That number, combined with National Guard and Reserve forces, puts the U.S. total at 998,500 soldiers. National Guard and Reserve numbers are expected to stay at 336,000 and 189,500 for fiscal 2023, the report says. Gabe Camarillo, the undersecretary of the Army, commented: “We did not want, as we looked ahead at recruiting projections, to take any decrease in our quality.”He told Bloomberg that the move was \"pro-active\" and said that the decision to make the cuts was catalyzed by \"a focus on recruiting high-quality soldiers without lowering standards\" and not to free up cash in the budget. He also said he still expects the Army's numbers to rise within the next five years. Then, he attributed some of the \"pro-active\" decision to a \"tight labor market\", stating: “All employers, to include the Army, are facing significant challenges just as a result of a tight labor market that we see across our economy. That creates a lot of the conditions that we are responding to.”The Army is asking for $178 billion in funding for 2023, up $2.8 billion from 2022. The additional funds are being used for \"real growth\" and \"inflation\", the Army's Director of Budget, Maj. Gen. Mark Bennett, said. “We are able to maintain our momentum. We did not need to look at our modernization accounts as sources of major reductions of any kind,” Camarillo concluded.,\n",

       " \ttitle = Russian Palladium And Platinum – Too Important To Sanction,\n",
       " \ttext = Submitted by Ronan Manly, BullionStar.comWhen on 7 March, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) suspended 6 Russian precious metals refiners from the London Good Delivery Lists for Gold and Silver, and in the process blocked from the London market any new gold and silver bars produced by these refiners, one unanswered question was whether the London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM) was going to follow suit and also suspend Russian precious metals refiners from its Good Delivery Lists for Palladium and Platinum.This was more than a theoretical question because two of the refiners excluded from the gold and silver Good Delivery Lists by the LBMA were JSC Krastsvetmet (located in Krasnoyarsk) and Prioksky Plant of Non-Ferrous Metals, and both Krastsvetmet and Prioksky were also accredited refiners on the LPPM’s Good Delivery List for both Platinum and Palladium .For anyone reading BullionStar Blogs, this LBMA – LPPM conundrum was not a surprise since we highlighted it on 28 February, saying that:“Note too that the LBMA also administers the London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM), and there are two Russian refineries on both the current LPPM Good Delivery List for Platinum and the LPPM Good Delivery List for Palladium, namely “The Gulidov Krasnoyarsk Non-Ferrous Metals Plant” and the “Prioksky Plant of Non-Ferrous Metals” (a.k.a. Krastsvetmet and Prioksky).To make matters worse, since the CME Group (operator of the COMEX) more or less clones the LBMA Good Delivery Lists and had the 6 Russian refiners on the COMEX “Approved Brands” lists, this forced the COMEX to follow the LBMA’s lead on 7 March and exclude the same 6 Russian precious metals refiners from these ‘Approved Brands’ lists for gold and silver, while leaving the Krastsvetmet and Prioksky refiners on the COMEX Approved List for Platinum and leaving Krastsvetmet on the COMEX Approved List for Palladium.   For how could the LBMA in London, as it said in its press release on 7 March, suspend the 6 Russian refiners “with immediate effect” and “in light of UK/EU/US sanctions”, while its sister organization, the LPPM in London, did nothing about Krastsvetmet and Prioksky?And how could the Commodity Exchange (COMEX) also on 7 March “effective immediately“ and “until further notice”, suspend “the approved status for warranting and delivery” of the 6 Russian refiners for their gold and silver brands, while leaving Krastsvetmet and Prioksky on its Platinum/Palladium approved brands lists?  The answer is of course about money, and the fact that sanctions are a political weapon which can be ignored in hypocritical closed doors meetings in the City of London and Chicago/New York when it affects the bottom line too much.LBMA and LPPM – Same People, Different HatsAs Reuters’ Peter Hobson pointed out in a 8 March article titled “London market green-lights Russia’s palladium while blocking its gold”:“The London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM), an industry association, said it would keep the two Russian refiners it accredits on its “good delivery” list of firms whose material is eligible to trade in London.“Traders and analysts said removal of the palladium refiners from London trading would have worsened worries over Russian supply that have sent prices to record highs.”On 8 March, the LPPM also – with a straight face – added a hypocritical press release to its website, which said:LPPM GOOD DELIVERY PLATINUM AND PALLADIUM UPDATEDue to the terrible events taking place in Ukraine, the LPPM has reviewed its Good Delivery list and the US, EU and UK sanctions. Following that review it has decided to make no changes to the Good Delivery list.We will however continue to monitor and review the situation.”In other words, due to, in the words of the LPPM, “terrible events” in Ukraine, the LPPM decided to do nothing, all because Russian palladium and platinum are too important to sanction.On the same day, Reuters published another version of its 8 March article  – which is now only available on the NASDQ website and is titled ”Russian refiners still OK to trade, says London Platinum and Palladium Market\", in which Peter Hobson wrote that:“Following a meeting of the Management Committee of the LPPM…, there will be no changes to our Good Delivery list,\" the LPPM’s Chief Administrative Officer, Jane-Anne Wardley, said.So now we know that it was the LPPM Management Committee which made the decision to ‘make no changes’ to the LPPM Good Delivery Lists, despite what they called the ‘terrible events’ in Ukraine.It’s A Big Club & You Ain’t In It!And what or who is this LPPM Management Committee?From the LPPM website management committee page we see that the LPPM Management Committee comprises individuals representing 9 heavy weight entities which are involved in the global platinum and palladium market, four of which are bank entities. These 9 entities and their representatives are:    Chairman – John Cullen, Johnson Matthey Plc (US/UK refinery)Members – Vincent Domien, HSBC (bank)Thomas Kendall, ICBC Standard Bank (bank)Anton Down, Royal Bank of Canada (bank)Vikas Chamaria, T D Securities (bank)John Metcalf, BASF Metals Limited (trader – note BASF which took over the old Engelhard)Andy Daniel, Heraeus Metals Germany GmbH (German refinery)Joe Stefans, MKS Pamp SA (Swiss refinery)David Jollie, Anglo Platinum Marketing Ltd (part of Anglo American Platinum, miner)Note – Vincent Domien, now of HSBC, was a SocGen director of the London Gold Market Fixing Limited (the old London Gold Fixing) until 30 August 2019.Seven of these Management Committee members are Full Members of the LPPM, namely HSBC, ICBC Standard, Toronto Dominion (TD), Johnson Matthey, Heraeus, MKS PAMP, and  BASF Metals. The other two, Royal Bank of Canada and Anglo Platinum, are associate members of the LPPM.As there are only 14 Full Members of the LPPM, the other 7 full members of the LPPM which are not on the LPPM Management Committee are 4 banks – Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, UBS, and Standard Chartered Bank, and 3 precious metals refiners – Metalor (Swiss), Valcambi (Swiss) and Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo (Japanese).In addition, the ‘Market Making’ members of the LPPM (whose trading desks make two-way markets in palladium and platinum) are Goldman Sachs, HSBC, ICBC Standard Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Standard Chartered Bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and UBS.And there’s more. Each business day in London, a group comprising Goldman Sachs, HSBC, ICBC Standard, Johnson Matthey, BASF Metals, along with StoneX, take part in the daily LBMA platinum and palladium auctions so as to ‘establish’ benchmark prices for the daily LBMA Platinum Price and the LBMA Palladium Price (price data which by the way is intellectually owned by Precious Metals Prices Limited – which is a subsidiary of the LBMA).And finally, these LBMA Platinum and Palladium auctions, which are run for the benefit of the LPPM’s ‘market’ (a market which is behind the scenes administered by the LBMA), are run on a daily basis by the London Metal Exchange (LME).As George Carlin once said “It’s A BIG Club & You Ain’t In It!”Shockingly, the LPPM’s decision to keep the Russian refiners Krastsvetmet and Prioksky on the LPPM Good Delivery Lists for Palladium and Platinum comes despite the fact that the LPPM’s own ‘Responsible Sourcing program” which is overseen by the LPPM Management Committee, has a “Sanctions Policy” which says:“SANCTIONS POLICYFailure to meet the standards required could have serious implications for LPPM Good Delivery refiners. Sanctions could include suspension subject to resolution or being transferred to the Former List with immediate effect.”However, on this occasion, the LPPM Management Committee seems to have thrown its sanctions policy out of the window, hoping that no one would notice.A palladium crisis could find Boris Johnson back on his bike againThe Criticality of Russian Palladium SupplyWhile South Africa is responsible for 75% of global Platinum mining supply, with Russia accounting for just over 10% (Russia is forecast to generate a 2022 supply of 661 koz out of a global total of 6119 koz according to the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC)), it is in the Palladium market where Russiaan supply is critical, since Russia accounts for 40% of the global palladium supply. See the latest WPIC presentation slide desk (dated March 2022) here. In Russia, mined palladium is a by-product of nickel mining, with nearly all Russian palladium supply being mined by the mammoth MMC Norilsk Nickel The next biggest palladium producer is the South African-US combine Sibanye-Stillwater.According to the latest Heraeus “Palladium Standard” report from September 2021 (produced by SFA Oxford), Russian palladium production in 2021 was forecast to be 2350 koz out of a global total of 6,770 koz (or 35% of global palladium mine supply).However, in 2021, Russian palladium supply was less than normal due to mine flooding and a concentrator accident, which reduced supply by about 365 koz. So in a normal year, Russian palladium supply is about 2800 koz, or about 40% of global annual supply of 7000 koz. See the Heraeus ‘Palladium Standard’ report here. On the demand side, palladium is critical for the global automobile industry (along with platinum), where both metals are used in auto-catalytic converters that reduce exhaust emissions – as both palladium and platinum are excellent catalysts and are somewhat substitutable. Both palladium and platinum are also used widely in industry, e,g. in computer chips and electronic devices.Furthermore, both metals have a large demand driver in the form of jewelry and importantly, platinum and palladium are both investment precious metals, with both metals are held in physically backed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and both metals are fabricated into investment platinum and investment palladium bars and coins.ConclusionSo now you can see how important Russian palladium is to the LPPM trade group, and to the banks, traders, and refiners of the LPPM.If Russian palladium stopped flowing to market, there would be serious problems, especially for the global auto and computer chip industries. And the same, to a lesser extent, goes for Russian platinum supplies.And since the LPPM could hardly sanction Russian platinum without sanctioning palladium as this would draw even more attention to the double standards and political nature of the sanctions, hence the LPPM put its head in the sand and sanctioned neither, hoping that it would all blow over.Which is also why the US/UK/EU sanctions have avoided sanctioning the ‘final boss’, the giant Norilsk Nickel. Because Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest palladium producer and a major producer of platinum is, as the Wall Street Journal put it recently, ‘Too Big to Sanction’.So now you can see why the LPPM Management Committee threw its sanctions book out the window when confronted with having to sanction the Russian palladium and platinum refiners Krastsvetmet and Prioksky, despite what the LPPM called the ‘terrible events” in Ukraine. Because, in the world of the bullion bank controlled palladium and platinum markets in the City of London and on COMEX, money talks while everything else walks.And the bullion banks couldn’t have the palladium and platinum prices spiking in London in the same way as the nickel price debacles. What if it spilled over into silver? Or gold?And which is why on 24 March, when UK prime minister Boris Johnson, ahead of the NATO-G7-EU meetings in Brussels, talked about “tightening the economic vice\" on Vladimir Putin, and “looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves”, while not surprisingly failing to mention the LPPM and the double standards of the City of London when it comes to palladium and platinum.Because “tightening the economic vice\" on Russian palladium and platinum, would seize up the global auto industry and could find Boris having to ride his bike to work each day instead of being chauffeured in a 2022 emissions-friendly Bentley.This article was originally published on the BullionStar website under the same title \"Russian Palladium and Platinum – Too Important to Sanction\".,\n",

       " \ttitle = Shanghai Officials Conceal COVID Deaths At City Nursing Homes Amid Punishing Lockdown,\n",
       " \ttext = As local authorities in Shanghai prepare to start the second phase of the Shanghai lockdown, the western press has seized on reports that the death toll from the omicron-driven outbreak in China's most populous city (and its financial capital) has been even larger than authorities have let on - the latest indication that the numbers being released by China's public-health authorities have been sanitized, and that the true scope of the outbreak is even larger than believed.An outbreak at a Shanghai home for the elderly has killed a handful of residents in recent days, deaths that haven't been reflected in authorities' official numbers, which haven't reported any deaths in the hundreds of homes for the elderly in the city.Citing a group of orderlies who had been sent to one of China's quarantine facilities, WSJ reported that an unknown number of bodies had been removed from the facility, where at least 100 positive cases have been confirmed among its residents.Of course, concealing deaths in the city's nursing homes might strike a chord with Americans, who remember all too well former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's deliberate under-reporting of the number of deaths at nursing homes in the Empire State during the first months of the pandemic.In Shanghai, one of the orderlies who spoke with WSJ said they were tasked with dressing the body of one dead patient, an order that made the orderly fear for their safety.\"I was scared to death. I said, 'Look, look, those are for dead bodies,'\" another orderly said, recalling the sight of half a dozen hearses parked at the hospital gate at night.But the orderlies weren't the only sources who spoke with WSJ (speaking with members of the foreign press is, of course, discouraged by the CCP, and these individuals spoke out at great personal risk). Separately, the son of a patient at the hospital said that his father had died within the past week, a friend of the son told the Journal, adding that others who had visited the hospital reported seeing the bodies of at least a dozen deceased patients.More than half a dozen users on several of China’s major social-media platforms have also posted messages alleging unreported deaths at the hospital in recent days.Another orderly told WSJ that a surprising number of providers and staffers at the facility had been infected.\"Orderlies, nurses and doctors, we’re all infected,\" she said.The facility, Shanghai Donghai, has been around for 20 years, and is run by a state-owned food conglomerate with 1,800 beds and an orthopedics ward that also treats younger patients. It's the city's biggest elder-care facility by capacity, and it reported zero COVID infections in 2021.But why would local authorities want to hide the number of infections and deaths if they're ordering lockdowns anyway?Well, as Nikkei noted on Thursday, the reputations of prominent local bureaucrats are being threatened, so they're doing anything they can to mask the severity of the situation to try and salvage their reputations. With the National Party Congress set for later this year, Li Qiang, the Communist Party secretary of Shanghai, is hoping to be elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, China's most powerful policy-setting body. He's seen as one of President Xi's closest allies, and before the lockdown, he had been expected to move to Beijing and become a vice premier in charge of the economy. Unfortunately for him, the lockdown looks to have disrupted such plans.Now, those within the party who oppose President Xi's power grab (the party's paramount leader is expected to clinch a third term as leader during the party Congress this fall, making him the first leader since Chairman Mao to break the limit of two five-year terms) are hoping to use the situation in Shanghai to block Li's promotion, depriving Xi of an important ally in the Politburo.Reflecting the outpouring of  public anger stoked by the Shanghai lockdown (as supplies of food and medicine have grown increasingly strained), one local official told ABC News that the city's leadership failed to adequately prepare.Ma Chunlei, a senior Shanghai official, acknowledged shortcomings in the city's response. Authorities have rushed to bolster food deliveries to the city after panic buying stripped store shelves of necessities.\"We didn’t prepare sufficiently enough,\" Ma said. \"We sincerely accept the criticisms from the public and are making efforts to improve it.\"Meanwhile, city of Shanghai was preparing to reopen the eastern half of the city, and shut its western half, as the staggered 9-day lockdown continues. While Shanghai's lockdown has slowed factory output (a byproduct of lockdowns across China), authorities have decided to lift a lockdown in Jilin Province (the epicenter of China's worst outbreak since Wuhan). Starting tomorrow, locals will be able to move about freely, although they will be required to wear masks and, when indoors, stay 1 meter (3 feet) apart. Public gatherings in parks and squares are prohibited.,\n",

       " \ttext = By Russell Clark of Capital Flows and Asset Markets SubstackOne of the reasons I left the money management game was that many of the theories that I had used to manage money stopped working. Some of them were original, some I taken from others, and some I had modified. I knew I need to take time off and have a think. I also knew that I needed to read different books to get my mind thinking differently. As it happens, I have just finished reading Agatha Christies “Death on the Nile” (excellent book), and I particularly enjoyed how he looked at all the clues, organized them, and then slowly but surely eliminate suspects until only the murderer, however unlikely, was left.For me, recent market action has eliminated the final suspect for what has caused the extremely long lived bull market in US equities. I had speculated that robustness of the US stock market was a feature of extremely loose credit conditions. These loose credit conditions were only possible due to a long drawn out commodity bear market, and hence if we had a spike in commodity prices which led to rising bond yields, then were likely to see a much weaker equity market.Commodity prices, and particularly food prices have spiked. Food prices had spiked in 1996 before the Asian Financial Crisis, again in 2007 before the GFC and in 2011 during the Eurocrisis. My working assumption was that another spike would also signal problems. But with the exception of Chinese equities, major equity market returns over last 12 months have been robust. MSCI World is barely 5% from highs. I have used food, but energy price spikes have also led to weaker equity markets historically too.I have also learnt to be cautious on equities when the Asian Dollar Index is going sideways or falling. Even after the Asian Financial Crisis, Asian currencies strengthened during the dot com bubble. Since a beak in 2010, they have been generally poor, even as U S equities have powered on.I have also used net international investment position data to inform whether to be bearish on a currency or equity market. This worked well on pointing out danger in the dot-com bubble, and the top in the US dollar in the early 2000s. It also worked well for the Japanese bubble economy, the Asian Financial Crisis and the Eurocrisis. But this model has had me bearish on the US dollar and US equities since 2016, so very wrong indeed (see Spotting Property Bubbles in East Asia in my Archive for more details).On a much shorter term basis, the S&P 500 has seemingly broken out of its relationship with HYG US (High Yield ETF). A similar chart can be drawn using mortgage rates, which have spiked. I would include - but Substack says I am at the limit already in this post!I realized that I needed to look at all this clues again, and have a think about why they worked before, but did not work this time. And, by eliminating suspects, and having a long think, I think I have the answer. The murderer of all possible bear markets in the US dollar and US equity is….. (to be continued).,\n",

       " \ttext = Tiny Sri Lanka is struggling through an economic crisis that is having terrible repercussions for its economy, as a brutal energy crisis threatens to blossom into shortages of food and other essential goods.Thanks to an energy crisis (and China's reluctance to allow the country to restructure its debts), Sri Lanka is resorting to turning off its street lights to save electricity as its worst economic crisis in decades bites, forcing - among other cutbacks - the temporary closure of the local stock market as the impact of the crisis is felt (the Colombo Stock Exchange reduced daily trading to two hours from the usual four-and-a-half because of the power cuts for the rest of this week at the request of brokers).The island nation of 22 million people is struggling with rolling power cuts for up to 13 hours a day as the government is unable to make payments for fuel imports because of a lack of foreign exchange.According to Reuters, the energy-drained country expects a diesel shipment paid for under a $500 million line of credit from neighboring India is expected to arrive on Saturday, but the situation isn't expected to improve any time soon, as power restriction will need to continue, according to the country's power minister.\"We have already instructed officials to shut off street lights around the country to help conserve power,\" Power Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi told reporters....\"Once that arrives we will be able to reduce load shedding hours but until we receive rains, probably some time in May, power cuts will have to continue,\" Wanniarachchi told reporters, referring to the rolling power cuts.\"There's nothing else we can do.\"Another reason for the power crisis (and a lesson for all nations that are aiming to ramp up 'green' energy sources): Water levels at reservoirs feeding hydro-electric projects had fallen to record lows, while demand had also hit record levels during the hot, dry season, she said.As Reuters explains, the crisis in Sri Lanka is the result of a confluence of factors that have drained the country's foreign exchange reserves.The crisis is a result of badly timed tax cuts and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic coupled with historically weak government finances, leading to foreign exchange reserves dropping by 70% in the last two years.Sri Lanka was left with reserves of $2.31 billion as of February, forcing the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund and other countries, including India and China.And if the situation doesn't improve soon, the small country's energy crisis could metastasize into a food crisis. Because, as the AFP explains, without fuel, the country's fishermen have been stranded on shore, unable to reel in the day's catch. And the ramifications are being felt by families across the country.\"If we queue up by five in the morning, then we will get fuel by three in the afternoon, on good days,\" Arulanandan, a seasoned member of Negombo's close-knit fishing community, tells AFP.\"But for some, even that is not possible, because by the time they get to the end of the queue, the kerosene is gone.\"As they look for somebody to blame, the locals have settled on one key culprit: Beijing, and its 'debt diplomacy', which seems to have caught Colombo in its trap.One of the reasons behind economic crisis in Sri Lanka is its huge debt to China.\n",

       " \t Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday jokingly called for an investigation into Russian ties with environmentalists to needle liberals who pushed the narrative the Kremlin colluded with the Trump campaign.“Maybe we should get a special prosecutor,” Paul said during an appearance on Newsmax Tuesday. “Maybe we need to spend about $100 million investigating Putin’s contributions to the green alarmists in our country.” “I don’t know if it’s true,” Paul added. “But can you imagine, there’s probably more truth to that than any of the BS they put forward about trying to connect the Russians to the Trump campaign.” (RELATED: Peter Doocy Presses Jen Psaki On ‘Climate Leadership’ After Biden Blocked Keystone XL Pipeline, But Allowed Putin’s Pipeline)  Accusations about Russian funding of anti-fossil fuel groups have been around for years. https://t.co/EGVIKhZmjo — ThePoliticalInsider (@TPInsidr) March 31, 2022  Environmental groups opposed the Keystone XL pipeline and have also pushed for restrictions on oil and gas drilling. Many environmentalists also opposed hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, claiming it contributed to climate change and harmed water supplies. Critics say these efforts, coupled with current Biden administration policies, contributed to high oil and gas prices, which means more revenue for the Russian government.  “From Day 1, Biden and the Democrats’ actions and statements pushed gasoline prices steadily higher,” conservative commentator Deroy Merdock recently wrote in the New York Post. There is currently no evidence that American environmentalists are in cahoots with the Kremlin. Likewise, the narrative that former President Donald Trump’s campaign was in league with Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been discredited.,\n",

       " \t A reporter questioned White House communications director Kate Bedingfield Thursday on whether the White House “stands by” President Joe Biden’s remarks on his son Hunter’s business dealings.The reporter reiterated previous statements Biden made during a 2020 presidential debate that there was “nothing unethical” about Hunter’s business dealings in China and Ukraine, nor did he make money from state-owned Chinese energy companies. “We absolutely stand by the president’s comment and I would point you to the reporting on this, which references statements that we made at the time that we gave to the Washington Post who worked on this story,” Bedingfield said. “But as you know, I do not speak for Hunter Biden so not more than I can say on that.” WATCH:   The New York Times confirmed the authenticity of a laptop abandoned by the president’s son in a Delaware repair shop in 2019. The Case ID on the laptop’s receipt linked to the FBI’s code for transnational money laundering investigations found there was sufficient evidence to open a case against Hunter and his international business dealings. (RELATED: The Biden Admin’s Ties To Ukraine Go Deeper Than Hunter And Burisma) A grand jury in Delaware is in the midst of an investigation of possible tax violations, money laundering and foreign lobbying in connection to the president’s son. The laptop contained thousands of emails linking Hunter to the Chinese energy company CEFC China Energy Co. Hunter and his uncle, James Biden, reportedly received millions of dollars in wire payments from its founder, Ye Jianming. Hunter’s firm, Rosemont Seneca Thornton, also received millions in wire payments from a Chinese businessman with reported ties to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Hunter joined the board of directors for the Ukrainian state-owned energy company, Burisma, in April 2014, to which one Burisma official reportedly said “enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.” Reports linked some of his business dealings to Ukrainian oligarch Nikolai Zlochevsky, the owner of the company, where Hunter and his business partner, Devon Archer, made nearly $80,000 a year. A 2020 Senate report also alleges that Burisma paid a consulting firm owned by Hunter and Archer more than $3.5 million from May 2014 to February 2016. The firm then sent a total of $752,054 to Hunter’s law firm, Owasco.,\n",

       " \tTemba Bavuma steadied South Africa with 53 not out against Bangladesh before bad light ended play early with the Proteas 233-4 on the first day of the opening Test on Thursday. South Africa had controlled the first session and captain Dean Elgar and Sarel Erwee put on a 113-run opening stand before they fell in quick succession after lunch. Mehidy Hasan Miraz pulled off a brilliant run out of Keegan Petersen in Bangladesh's fightback in the middle of the day. But Bavuma buckled down after tea for his 18th test half-century. He was supported by Kyle Verreynne (27 not out) and their unbroken 53-run stand took South Africa to stumps, although only 76.5 overs had been bowled on the opening day when the umpires decided the light wasn't good enough to keep playing in Durban. Bangladesh is aiming to follow up on its groundbreaking victory in the one-day international series last week, which was the first time it had won a series of any kind in South Africa. The tourists' chances might also be aided by the fact that South Africa is missing a number of its top players to the Indian Premier League. The Proteas are without batsmen Aiden Markram and Rassie van der Dussen, pace bowlers Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen, and allrounder Dwaine Pretorius, who all opted to play in the IPL instead of the two-test series against Bangladesh. South Africa was solid at the start to go to lunch on 95-0 as Bangladesh's bowlers initially struggled to find their range after putting the home team in to bat. Elgar led the way after clipping the first delivery of the day for four to set the tone for that first session. He eventually hit 11 fours in his 67 off 101 balls. Bangladesh gained some ground back with those three strikes after lunch. Miraz was central to that effort by bowling Erwee for 41 and then producing an excellent piece of fielding to get rid of Petersen for 19. Miraz made a diving stop with one hand and then released a throw almost in the same movement to run Petersen out with a direct hit. Ryan Rickelton made 21 on his test debut but mishit a pull shot off Ebadot Hossain after looking good with four boundaries. He hit a reverse sweep for four for his first runs in test cricket. Bavuma took control but will be the subject of yet more focus on the second day having converted just one of his half-centuries into a century in eight years of playing Tests. While poor light often ends play early in the east coast city of Durban, the day also had a strange start when play was delayed for more than 30 minutes because of a problem with one of the sight screens.,\n",

       " \tFormer Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi on Thursday indicated that she will not mind Nitish Kumar, her husband Lalu Prasad's arch rival, vacating his chair for a plush assignment in Delhi. The RJD leader was replying to questions from journalists who were trying to make sense of a reportedly off-the-cuff remark by Mr. Kumar which has triggered furious speculations that he may move to Delhi as the next Vice President of the country. “He should go. Everyone would like him to go away. (jana hi chahiye. Sabhi log chahenge ki chale jaayein”), she said replying to queries about the cryptic remark made by Mr. Kumar that he had been a member of both Houses in the State legislature and the Lok Sabha and a term in Rajya Sabha would complete his political journey. To a pointed query about speculations that Mr. Kumar could emerge as the BJP's choice for the post of Vice-President after the expiry of Venkaiah Naidu's term in a few months, the reticent Rabri Devi repied “achcha hi na rahega (will it not be good for him?)”. Mr. Kumar is reported to have made the Rajya Sabha remark during an informal chat with some journalists who had asked him about his recent tour of areas falling under the now abolished Barh Lok Sabha constituency which he had represented many times. The journalists had queried, apparently in a jocular vein, whether Kumar had plans to contest parliamentary elections again. A section of the media has since been running reports speculating that the JD(U) leader, who has been in power in Bihar since 2005 and has become the longest serving Chief Minister of the State, could move to Delhi for a top constitutional post. The reports also claim that he might agree to a new power-sharing formula in the state where the BJP, which had won far more seats than the JD(U) in the 2020 assembly polls, could be allowed to have its own Chief Minister. Incidentally, Bihar remains the only State in the entire “Hindi belt” where the BJP has never had its own Chief Minister.BJP leaders like MLA Vinay Bihari have openly pitched for “our own CM” while taking care to add that the final decision rests with the national leadership. Upon returning to power for his fourth consecutive term in office, Mr. Kumar had claimed that he had, following the JD(U)'s relatively poor performance in polls, expressed the desire to step down and make way for the BJP but relented only after the alliance partner insisted that he continue occupying the top post. Nonetheless, the State's hyperactive rumour bill is busy coming out with names of BJP leaders who could make it in the event of Mr. Kumar's departure. The “front-runners” include Nityanand Rai, the Minister of State for Home known to be trusted by both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, whose elevation brings the promise of breaching the sway of the RJD, the main Opposition party, over the sizeable Yadav community. Meanwhile, all eyes are fixed at the next move by Mr. Kumar, a deft player of the game of politics, who had cryptically told an election rally in 2020 that it was his “aakhiri chunav”, only to reiterate later “I will continue to work for the people of Bihar for as long as they wish”.,\n",

The indicators for this include the fact that the digital asset is now trading above the 30 and 50-day moving averages.

It measures the total costs associated with operating a certain investment fund.According to Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, the offering is poised to severely undercut Switzerland-based crypto ETP issuer 21Shares, which charges its investors a 2.5% management fee.Earlier this week, the Solana, Cardano and Polkadot ETPs were also launched on Zurich-based SIX Swiss Exchange and Frankfurt-based Xetra.Cryptocurrency ETPs provide investors with exposure to a slew of cryptocurrencies in a secure and cost-efficient manner. Such products are typically popular in Europe, where regulators have shown a willingness to list such products. As reported by U.Today, 21Shares recently launched ETPs for such exotic cryptocurrencies as Decentraland (MANA) and Aave (AAVE).Crypto investment firms are getting more creative. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that CoinShares had joined forces with crypto exchange FTX in order to launch a Solana-based ETP that would offer staking rewards in order to reduce management costs for investors.No Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.While there is already stiff competition among ETP issuers that offer exposure to esoteric altcoins, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to greenlight a physically backed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Leading cryptocurrency asset management Grayscale Investments, which is vying to be the first to launch a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, recently warned that its quest to launch such a product could result in a lawsuit against the formidable regulator.Source: https://u.today/wisdomtree-launches-solana-cardano-and-polkadot-etps-on-euronext-exchangesPost navigation,\n",

Santiment also noted an uptick in the number of whales on the network. However, a little over half of the addresses on the network are out of the money, meaning they are holding ADA at a loss. What does this all mean for Cardano’s price in the weeks to come?ADA- 1DSource: ADA/USDT on TradingViewThe longer-term market structure for ADA had been bearish as it went on a strong downtrend from September to early March. In the past few weeks, the price has broken out of a descending wedge pattern (white) and broken past the $1 level. The $1 level has been a strong area of resistance, both technically and psychologically in the past.Yet, the bulls were able to push past this area, retest it to find some demand, and push toward $1.26. The next level of resistance lies at $1.39, with a bearish order block at $1.38 (red box) from late December.Further north, the $1.6-$1.62 level would be the next area to look toward, should ADA succeed in pushing past $1.26 and $1.4.RationaleSource: ADA/USDT on TradingViewThe indicators pointed to strong bullish momentum and good demand in the past couple of weeks. The RSI rose to 73 and no bearish divergence on higher timeframes was seen yet. The Awesome Oscillator also rose high above the zero line. Both of them showed strong bullish momentum.The Chaikin Money Flow stood at 0.17, which was a sign of high demand in the past month. Alongside it, the OBV has also risen in the past couple of weeks. However, this was not enough to breach the orange level, which was the most recent lower high on the OBV.ConclusionThe indicators showed there was a chance for further upside for Cardano. However, the $1.26-$1.4 area, and even slightly above that, could be a place where large market participants exit the markets just as retail enters on a wave of fresh enthusiasm. This could be the exit liquidity for a large move downward, and longer-term investors need to be wary of such possibilities.Source: https://ambcrypto.com/cardano-with-soaring-on-chain-transactions-heres-how-far-ada-can-go/Post navigation,\n",

The support-turned-resistance $1.15 remains a critical level to trade. Increased selling pressure could result in a pullback in the price in the short term at least.If the price breaks below $1.15 on a daily closing basis then it could test the psychological $1.0 level. This would be a major setback for the bulls.An extended sell off-could further exploit the lows of March 23 at $0.95.On the flip side, a shift in the bullish sentiment and if the price is able to sustain the session’s lower level would make bulls hopeful. On moving higher, the first upside target could be found at $1.25.Next, market participants would approach the critical 200-EMA (Exponential Moving Average) at $1.30.As of press time, ADA/USD is trading at $1.15, down 3.28% for the day. The eight-largest cryptocurrency by the market cap is standing at $1,669,029,044 with 16% gains.A rise in volume with a decline in price is a bearish sign for the price.Technical indicators:RSI: The daily Relative Strength Index still trades above the average line. However, it retraced from the higher levels. The indicator shows negative divergence with the price that indicates an impending bearish momentum in the asset.MACD: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence holds above the mid-line but with a receding bullish sentiment.

       " \tCardano SPO, interview with VET Pool [VET]\n",
       " \tCardano SPO [VET] donates a certain amount of revenue to WWF\n",
       " \tHi, thanks for your time. Tell us something about yourself, where are you based and what is your background?\n",
       " \tHello. I live in Korea and run a veterinary hospital as a veterinarian. Currently, I am interested not only in Cardano, but also tokens and NFTs in the Cardano ecosystem. Also, as a veterinarian and SPO, I am interested in donating and helping animal organizations. In this way, I mainly treat animals as a veterinarian during the day and work as an SPO and investor at night. \n",
       " \tTreating animals is very rewarding, but seeing sick animals and their sad caregivers, does hurt me often. So, usually in the evening, when I come home from work, I keep thinking about what happened in the hospital during the day, and it became stressful. Because I have a great sense of mission for animals and my hospital, it was difficult to balance work and life.\n",
       " \tHowever, after getting to know Cardano, I recently enjoyed my time after work. In reality, I am more tired than before, but I am happy. Being a veterinarian is my job and my mission, and Cardano makes my life better. I found work-life balance through Cardano.\n",
       " \tHow did you discover Cardano and why did you become a Stake Pool Operator (SPO)?\n",
       " \tFour years ago, I was just a simple Ada follower and investor. However, I was fascinated by Cardano and Charles’ philosophy aimed at decentralization. And I also wanted to be a part of Cardano’s ecosystem. So I made a pool. As a veterinarian, it is a separate job, but since last year, I studied Linux that is unfamiliar to me, and made a pool in the second half of last year by referring to the data of the Cardano community. \n",
       " \tI wanted to set a precedent that proves Cardano’s ecosystem, which is truly decentralized, where even people who do not know much about IT or computer programming can run a pool. As a veterinarian and SPO, I wanted to promote Cardano to people who love animals.\n",
       " \tLooking at the various pools, I realized that each pool has different goals. Furthermore, I found out that the pool gathers people who agree on the concept of the pool and support and sympathize with that direction. I am a veterinarian, I love animals, and I have a sense of duty to protect them. A portion of the hospital’s revenue is already being donated to animals. \n",
       " \tIn the world of Cardano, I thought there would be many people with the same thoughts as me. So I thought it would be good for people like me to gather and stake together and donate some of our profits to animals in the future. That is the characteristic of the Pool that I can achieve by making use of my strengths. So, VET POOL was born.\n",
       " \tWhat are your thoughts on the network of Stake Pool Operators? How hard is it for small SPOs to attract delegators?\n",
       " \tIt has become more difficult for small SPOs to attract delegators than before. Delegators do not delegate to a small pool because steady block generation is not easy if the pool isn’t big enough. In addition, the staked ADA of small pools decreased further due to Cardano DeFi and ISPOs. One of Cardano’s greatest strengths is decentralization, and if the activity of small pools decreases, I think that decentralization will gradually weaken.\n",
       " \tI also want to know: besides Twitter, YouTube, Discord, etc., where else can you meet various delegators? What more can I do? We are always thinking. We also run Twitter and made a staking video on YouTube. But delegators are not increasing. Rather, I became friends with many small pool SPOs like me. I am genuinely curious as to where I can meet delegators and attract them.\n",
       " \tIf you look at Twitter recently, small pools are increasingly retiring. It’s sad to see my SPO colleagues leave, but I always think that it could be my story soon. You have to be strong though!\n",
       " \tAs a veterinarian, what applications of blockchain technology do you see in your field and more generally in the medical sector?\n",
       " \tBlockchain technology has endless possibilities in medicine and veterinary medicine. It will be cheaper and easier to register and use patient records on the blockchain network. If the registration and reporting records of rare or extinct animals are recorded with blockchain, information can be easily shared around the world and animals can be protected.\n",
       " \tGreat contribution. Any final thoughts? Where can people stay in touch?\n",
       " \tCardano is a project with great potential for the future. It is a blockchain project for the public that is particularly focused on decentralization compared to other blockchain projects. I look forward to the future of Cardano. You can easily contact our pool through Twitter. Please feel free to get in touch with us.\n",
       " \tCardano delegators who love animals, you can invest, but you can also donate for animals. Animal lovers are even more welcome. Finally, thank you so much for organizing this interview for small pools. This is also a great strength and help for SPOs like me. Thank you so much.\n",

       " \ttext = Place/Date: – April 1st, 2022 at 8:25 am UTC · 2 min read  Contact: Cardano Village, Source: Cardano Village With the active smart contracts on Cardano and the extensive attention being garnered by metaverses in the industry, numerous metaverse projects are already well underway.Yet, Cardano Village remains the only metaverse project that has been mentioned by Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, and IOHK on Twitter.This project, which is currently undervalued on the market, has vast potential and immense possibilities.At the time of the initial minting, the team was put into the spotlight by the Cardano community for its beautiful artwork and rapidly minted land parcels while releasing MAP in PC, WEB, and Mobile environments simultaneously, proving without a doubt that it has a formidable grasp of the requisite technological prowess.To our surprise, the Cardanian Korea Team completed all these tasks within just a 3-month timeframe.​Despite the fact that only 1 of the 5 planned series has been released thus far, about 4,400 investors already own lands and buildings within this promising metaverse.​The team also recently created LIfe-Log ($LOG), which will be used throughout the metaverse, and released its White Paper.Furthermore, the team is prepping a proprietary Token Claim Service that will allow Cardano Village holders to occupy their tokens more easily.The $LOG Token, which was created in collaboration with Cardano’s DEX team from scratch, is rapidly being incorporated into the Cardano ecosystem.Tokens were initially distributed through Vyfi.io, one of the top Dex, and the current TVL is around $2.1M.Declaring the transition of the metaverse to FULL WEB MODE, they are gearing up to prove they can live up to their potential once and for all this June.Cardano Village will be holding a Public sale on Adax.pro Launchpad 7-10th April, starting at 12:00 UTC.Those wishing to take part should note that early Priority 24 hour round will be open for ADAX stakers on April 6th at 12:00 UTC.Cardano Village socials: Twitter.Subscribe to our telegram channel.
